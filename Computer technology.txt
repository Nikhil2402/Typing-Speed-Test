Computer technology for developing areas is often through the donation of technology to developing areas without thought for access to electricity or equipment maintenance. Many institutions, government, charitable, and for non-profit organizations require technology development often involving hardware or software design, and the coordination of donors, distributors, and deployers. Technical development overlaps with the fields of technical training, maintenance and support.
