Touch type training can improve any individual's typing speed and accuracy dramatically. A touch typist does not need to move the sight between the keyboard (that is obscured with fingers and may be poorly lit) and other areas that require attention. This increases productivity and reduces the number of errors. Every individual learns at a different pace, and routine practice is required to maintain a high typing speed and accuracy.
